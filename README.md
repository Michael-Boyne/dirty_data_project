### Task 3

The task I focus my write-up and analysis on is task 3.

For task 3 the code `data_cleaning_script.R` takes the data from inside `data/seabirds.xls` and creates the file inside `data/clean_bird_ship.csv`

The code in `Analysis.Rmd` answers 5 questions on the candy dataset.

### Task 4

I also did task 4, where the code `cleaning_script.R` takes the data from inside the three xls files in `raw_data/` and creates the file inside `clean_data/clean_candy.csv`

The code in `Analysis.Rmd` answers 8 questions on the candy dataset.
